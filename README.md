# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Within the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

## 🚀 Challenge 1 – Project Initialization & Learning Basics
- Initializes the React application using **Vite + React** for a faster development workflow.
- Introduces the project’s folder structure and starter configuration.
- Covers core React concepts such as JSX and component-based architecture.
- Sets up the foundational environment for all upcoming challenges.

### `npm start`
---

Starts the application in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

---

## 📖 Challenge 2 – Blog Post Display Feature
- Develops a `BlogPostDetail` component to render complete blog post content.
- Displays post title, author name, publication date, and properly formatted content.
- Gracefully handles cases where blog data is missing or invalid.
- Ensures responsive layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

The page automatically reloads when changes are made.  
Any linting issues will appear in the console.

---

### `npm test`
## ✍️ Challenge 3 – Blog Post Creation & Editing
- Creates a reusable `BlogPostForm` for adding and updating blog posts.
- Implements form validation for mandatory fields such as title, content, and author.
- Auto-fills existing data when editing a post.
- Uses responsive layouts (two-column layout on desktop, single-column on mobile).

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

---

### `npm run build`
## 🗑️ Challenge 4 – Blog Post Removal
- Adds a Delete option to safely remove blog posts.
- Displays a confirmation dialog before final deletion.
- Includes accessibility enhancements such as keyboard navigation and focus management.
- Ensures the confirmation dialog adapts well to different screen sizes.

Builds the app for production in the `build` directory.  
The build is optimized for performance and bundled for production use.

---

The output is minified, and filenames include content hashes.  
Your application is now ready for deployment.

---

## 🧭 Challenge 5 – Responsive Navigation & Page Layout
- Implements a fixed navigation bar with a logo and navigation links.
- Adds a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
- Uses a reusable `Layout` component containing header, main content, and footer.
- Ensures smooth transitions, accessibility compliance, and responsive behavior.

For more details, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) documentation.

---

### `npm run eject`
## 💬 Challenge 6 – Comment Feature
- Enables users to view and submit comments on blog posts.
- Displays commenter name, timestamp, comment text, and an optional avatar.
- Updates comments dynamically without reloading the page.
- Maintains responsive design and accessible form interactions.

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once ejected, reverting is not possible.

---

If you need full control over the build configuration, you can eject at any time.  
This will remove the default build dependency and expose all configuration files.

---

## 🔍 Challenge 7 – Blog Search Functionality
- Adds a search bar to filter blog posts by title or content.
- Supports case-insensitive and real-time search results.
- Highlights matching keywords and displays relevant post metadata.
- Delivers a responsive and accessible search experience.


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
